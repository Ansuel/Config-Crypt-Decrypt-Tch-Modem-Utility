# Config-Crypt-Decrypt-Tch-Modem-Utility

To use this file you need the Decrypt key and the config file.

The Decrypt key can be extracted by installing the modified gui and open the System Extra tab. 
The key must be 128 char and every config file is encrypted with the modem unique key. A wrong key will output a file full of junk.

To decrypt the encrypted config file, just select the file, insert the key and click Analyze and Decrypt. 
When all the need changes has been done, just select the decrypted file and click Analayze and Encrypt using the same key

The new file can now be loaded to the locked gui.
