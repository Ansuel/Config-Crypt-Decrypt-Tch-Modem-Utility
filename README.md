# Config-Crypt-Decrypt-Tch-Modem-Utility

To use this file you need the Decrypt key and the config file.

The Decrypt key can be extracted by installing the modified gui and open the System Extra tab. 
The key must be 128 char and every config file is encrypted with the modem unique key. A wrong key will output a file full of junk.
